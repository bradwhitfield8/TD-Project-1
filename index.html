      <h2>Background Info</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an aspiring web designer, social media manager and photographer who loves
         to explore, travel and design. I'm currently studying a tech-degree through
         Team Treehouse in order to become a digital nomad.
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied Exercise and Sports Science at University and worked as a personal
        trainer for many years, I now work in a bar as a door host but am trying to
        learn new skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love travelling and taking photos everywhere I go! I've travelled to
        Africa, South-East Asia, parts of the South Pacific and most recently lived
        in Canada for 7 months.

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I want to learn how to build amazing, interactive and visually beautiful web
        sites. I then want to be able to work remotely and travel to the following places:
      </p>
      <ul class="skills">
        <li>Australian Far North Coast</li>
        <li>West Coast of the USA</li>
        <li>Central and South America</li>
        <li>Europe - specifically Iceland</li>
      </ul>
        <p>
        I'd love to work for a company who would support me in my dreams to
        travel the world and promote my morals and values.
